# Vehicle-Inspection-Automation-using-Computer-Vision
#### In this project a vehicle Inspection automated platform were proposed using state-of-the-art technologies such as Computer Vision & Deep Learning, to reduce vehicle inspection time from weeks to a few minutes. Data were collected manually by scraping search engines and four deep learning models were developed.

<ul>
<li>The dataset were manually collected using a webscrapper except for the first model where stanford car dataset and imagenet were used</li>
<li>first model to check if the image is a car.
</li>
<li>second model to check if the car is damaged</li>
<li>third model to check car view (front, sides or rear)</li>
<li>fourth model to classify damage into five classes (broken headlight, tail
light, glass, scratches and dents)</li>
<li>output: first model accuray 98%, second model 97.5%, third model
78.5, fourth model 81%</li>
  <li> The models were deployed using django framework</li>
 <li> A paper were published for the development of the damage type classification model
