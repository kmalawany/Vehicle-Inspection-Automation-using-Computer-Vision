# Vehicle-Inspection-Automation-using-Computer-Vision
### In this project a vehicle Inspection automated platform were proposed using state-of-the-art technologies such as Computer Vision & Deep Learning, to reduce vehicle inspection time from weeks to a few minutes. Data were collected by team members and four deep learning models were developed.
